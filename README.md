Introduction:
This project aimed at empowering senior citizens in Saskatchewan through a simple Bingo game they can play over the phone. The goal is to make social interaction more accessible for seniors with limited mobility, using existing technology.

The UN SDG(s):
This project aligns with the 3rd goal of United Nations Sustainable Development Goal which is Ensure Healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all age Our goal is to enhance social engagement and mental well-being for senior citizens, particularly those facing mobility challenges. 

High-Level Project Vision:
Our vision is to create an accessible Bingo game that senior citizens can enjoy from their homes using only dial pad phones. This solution addresses the need for engaging activities for seniors with limited technological access and helps reduce social isolation.

Current State of Technology:
Currently, senior citizens in Saskatchewan primarily use basic dial pad phones, which limit their ability to engage in digital activities. We are leveraging these existing tools to build a telephone-based Bingo game. No new devices or complex technology are required, just a simple conference call system.

The Main Reason for Focusing on This Area:
The gap we are addressing is the lack of accessible digital activities for non-tech-savvy seniors. By utilizing their current phone setup, we can offer an easy-to-use, enjoyable activity without requiring them to learn new technology.

The Impact of the Project:
Locally, this project will offer seniors in Saskatchewan a new, fun way to engage socially. Globally, it could serve as a model for similar initiatives, helping seniors everywhere connect and stay mentally active, regardless of their technological skills.

The Audience and Community Orientation:
Our target audience is seniors aged 55+ in Saskatchewan, particularly those with limited mobility. The community will participate synchronously through conference calls, promoting real-time interaction, which is crucial for building a sense of connection.

Envisioned Constraints:
Some challenges include regulatory concerns from SLGA about remote Bingo gaming, and the need for high availability and accuracy in the game. Additionally, the design must accommodate limited technological skills of the audience.

Software Architecture & Prototypes:
The software architecture includes user authentication, Bingo card generation, and win detection. Weâ€™re developing a low-fidelity prototype to begin with, which allows for fast prototyping and user feedback. We will deliver minimum viable product with the essential features like unique bingo card generation, detecting winning patterns, and manual verification of a bingo call to ensure fairness.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, this project offers a simple yet impactful solution to enhance social participation among seniors. By using existing technology, we hope to improve their well-being and provide a model for similar initiatives globally.
